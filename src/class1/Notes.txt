   *Important things to keep in mind for this course:
     1) Pay attention during the class.
     2) Before each class I will be sharing short videos and
     the slides. It's a must that you go though those slides
     and watch the videos in the #course-announcement channel
     in Discord.
     3) A lot of practice.
     4) When practicing if you face any issues don't spend more
     than 15 minutes , take a screenshot and post it in the
     technical support channel.
