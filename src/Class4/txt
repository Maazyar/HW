1)Create a Java program and declare int variable that will hold a month.
Based on the value of the variable your program should print the name of the month.

2) You are a loan specialist and you need to ask user what is the amount of loan
is needed. If loan is less or equal to 200,000 then you would lend the money
otherwise you would reject the client.
3)You are DMV representative and you need to ask customer their age.
If they are 18 and older you will issue a driver license to them, otherwise you
will offer them to get a learners permit.
4)Create a Java program that will ask user to input city and temperature.
Your program should convert Fahrenheit into celsius and print “The temperature is
the city __ is __”
======================================================================
Scanner :
    Scanner is a class that contains all the logic to take the input from the
    user using the console and the keyboard.
Why should we use Scanner class?
    If we want to write interactive programs which can take input from users
    and based on the that input we want to write a logic.
What is the syntax of Scanner class:
    1) create the object of the scanner class using below code
    Scanner scanner=new Scanner(System.in);
    2) once we have the object of the scanner class we can call different methods
    to take different type of inputs from the user.
String(only one word):
    when we have a take String type of data only one
    word from user we can use the next() method.
String(complete line):
    if we are interested in all the words we can use nextLine method.
int:
    nextInt()
double:
    nextDouble()
boolean:
    nextBoolean()
char:
    For char there is no direct method we use the next method and then charAt method after that
    to extract the letters from the word.
    next().charAt(0) // here 0 means we are interested in the first letter


Note:
    1)we can press Ctrl+alt+l(windows) or (Cmd+opt+l) to format the code.
